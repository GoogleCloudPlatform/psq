psq - Cloud Pub/Sub Task Queue for Python.
==========================================

|Build Status| |Coverage Status| |PyPI Version|

``psq`` is an example Python implementation of a simple distributed task
queue using `Google Cloud Pub/Sub <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/>`__.

``psq`` requires minimal configuration and relies on Cloud Pub/Sub to
provide scalable and reliable messaging.

``psq`` is intentionally similar to `rq <http://python-rq.org/>`__ and
`simpleq <https://github.com/rdegges/simpleq>`__, and takes some
inspiration from `celery <http://www.celeryproject.org/>`__ and `this
blog
post <http://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/02/11/a-celerylike-python-task-queue-in-55-lines-of-code/>`__.

Installation
------------

Install via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__:

::

    pip install psq

Prerequisites
-------------

-  A project on the `Google Developers
   Console <https://console.developers.google.com>`__.
-  The `Google Cloud SDK <https://cloud.google.com/sdk>`__ installed
   locally.
-  You will need the `Cloud Pub/Sub API
   enabled <https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=datastore,pubsub>`__
   on your project. The link will walk you through enabling the API.
-  You will need to run ``gcloud auth`` before running these examples so
   that authentication to Google Cloud Platform services is handled
   transparently.

Usage
-----

First, create a task:

.. code:: python

    def adder(a, b):
        return a + b

Then, create a pubsub client and a queue:

.. code:: python

    from google.cloud import pubsub
    import psq


    PROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id'

    client = pubsub.Client(project=PROJECT_ID)

    q = psq.Queue(client)

Now you can enqueue tasks:

.. code:: python

    from tasks import adder

    q.enqueue(adder)

In order to get task results, you have to configure storage:

.. code:: python

    from google.cloud import pubsub
    import psq


    PROJECT_ID = 'your-project-id'

    ps_client = pubsub.Client(project=PROJECT_ID)
    ds_client = datastore.Client(project=PROJECT_ID)

    q = psq.Queue(
        ps_client,
        storage=psq.DatastoreStorage(ds_client))

With storage configured, you can get the result of a task:

.. code:: python

    r = q.enqueue(adder, 5, 6)
    r.result() # -> 11

You can also define multiple queues:

.. code:: python

    fast = psq.Queue(client, 'fast')
    slow = psq.Queue(client, 'slow')

Things to note
--------------

Because ``psq`` is largely similar to ``rq``, similar rules around tasks
apply. You can put any Python function call on a queue, provided:

-  The function is importable by the worker. This means the
   ``__module__`` that the function lives in must be importable.
   Notably, you can't enqueue functions that are declared in the
   **main** module - such as tasks defined in a file that is run
   directly with ``python`` or via the interactive interpreter.
-  The function can be a string, but it must be the absolutely importable path
   to a function that the worker can import. Otherwise, the task will fail.
-  The worker and the applications queuing tasks must share exactly the
   same source code.
-  The function can't depend on global context such as global variables,
   current\_request, etc. Pass any needed context into the worker at
   queue time.

Delivery guarantees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pub/sub guarantees your tasks will be delivered to the workers, but
``psq`` doesn't presently guarantee that a task completes execution or
exactly-once semantics, though it does allow you to provide your own
mechanisms for this. This is similar to Celery's
`default <http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/faq.html#faq-acks-late-vs-retry>`__
configuration.

Task completion guarantees can be provided via late ack support. Late
ack is possible with Cloud Pub/sub, but it currently not implemented in
this library. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`_.

There are many approaches for exactly-once semantics, such as
distributed locks. This is possible in systems such as
`zookeeper <http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#sc_recipes_Locks>`__
and `redis <http://redis.io/topics/distlock>`__.

Running a worker
----------------

Execute ``psqworker`` in the *same directory where you tasks are
defined*:

::

    psqworker.py config.q

``psqworker`` only operates on one queue at a time. If you want a server
to listen to multiple queues, use something like
`supervisord <http://supervisord.org/>`__ to run multiple ``psqworker``
processes.

Broadcast queues
----------------

A normal queue will send a single task to a single worker, spreading
your tasks over all workers listening to the same queue. There are also
broadcast queues, which will deliver a copy of the task to *every*
worker. This is useful in situations where you want every worker to
execute the same task, such as installing or upgrading software on every
server.

.. code:: python

    broadcast_q = psq.BroadcastQueue(client)

    def restart_apache_task():
        call(["apachectl", "restart"])

    broadcast_q.enqueue(restart_apache_task)

Broadcast queues provide an implementation of the solution described in
`Reliable Task Scheduling on Google Compute
Engine <https://cloud.google.com/solutions/reliable-task-scheduling-compute-engine>`__.

*Note*: broadcast queues do not currently support any form of storage
and do not support return values.

Retries
-------

Raising ``psq.Retry`` in your task will cause it to be retried.

.. code:: python

    from psq import Retry

    def retry_if_fail(self):
        try:
            r = requests.get('http://some.flaky.service.com')
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(e)
            raise Retry()

Flask & other contexts
----------------------

You can bind an extra context manager to the queue.

.. code:: python

    app = Flask(__name__)

    q = psq.Queue(extra_context=app.app_context)

This will ensure that the context is available in your tasks, which is
useful for things such as database connections, etc.:

.. code:: python

    from flask import current_app

    def flasky_task():
        backend = current_app.config['BACKEND']

Ideas for improvements
----------------------

-  some sort of storage solution for broadcast queues.
-  Memcache/redis value store.
-  @task decorator that adds a delay/defer function.
-  Task chaining / groups / chords.
-  Late ack.
-  Gevent worker.
-  batch support for queueing.
